# 🧠 DSA Revision Notes & Problem Approaches

This repository is a curated collection of my personal notes, problem-solving strategies, and topic-wise approaches for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It serves as a comprehensive reference for revision, interview preparation, and daily practice.

## 📌 What's Inside

This repo contains:

- ✍️ **Handwritten & typed notes** on common DSA topics  
- 📄 **PDFs and summaries** of problems solved across platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.  
- 🧩 **Topic-wise breakdowns** (e.g., Binary Trees, Graphs, DP, Stacks, etc.)  
- 🛠️ **Approach documents** explaining standard patterns and techniques  
- 📅 **Daily/weekly practice logs**  

---

## 🗂️ Structure

All documents are organized loosely by topic or session. New files are added regularly, and filenames reflect either the topic or the date/session of practice.

You may find:
- Topic-specific approaches (e.g., Two Pointer, Binary Search, Merge Intervals)
- Problem sets by data structure or algorithm
- Daily summaries and notes
- Competitive programming prep content

---

## 💡 Usage

You can use this repository to:

- Review key concepts before interviews or contests
- Study structured approaches to common problem types
- Track how problems evolve across difficulty levels
- Keep your own revision on track by using this as a reference

## 🚧 Still Growing

This is a **living repository** – I update it frequently with new problems, summaries, and refined strategies. Expect it to grow organically without rigid folder structures or numbering systems.
